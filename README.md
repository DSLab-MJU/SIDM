# SIDM

This is the official implementation of 'Semantic Interpolative Diffusion Model: Bridging the Interpolation to Masks and Colonoscopy Image Synthesis for Robust Generalization', to be published at **MICCAI 2025**.

## Requirements
```bash
conda create -n SIDM python=3.8.10
conda activate SIDM
conda install pytorch==1.11.0 torchvision==0.12.0 torchaudio==0.11.0 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
```

## Dataset Preparation
The proposed framework requires different processing for medical video data and snapshot data; therefore, a separation is necessary.

Please organize the dataset with the following structure:
```angular2
├── ${data_root}
│ ├── ${train_dataset_dir}
│ │ ├── images_video
│ │ │ ├── ***.png
│ │ ├── images
│ │ │ ├── ***.png
│ │ ├── masks_video
│ │ │ ├── ***.png
│ │ ├── masks
│ │ │ ├── ***.png

```

Details on the processing of the proposed background semantic labels can be found in ```datasets_label.log```.

## Training Your Own SIDM
To train your own SIDM, follow these steps:

1. Verify whether the training dataset, if it is a video dataset, has been properly separated.
2. Verify the data processing procedure by referring to ```polyp.py```.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python train.py --data_path ./TrainDataset \
               --save_dir 'your_path' \
               --image_size 256 \
               --n_epoch 5000 \
               --n_T 1000 \
               --batch_size 2 \

```
## Sampling with SIDM
To sampling with SIDM, run the following command:

```bash
python sampling.py
```

**Sampling**

You can configure the interpolation ratio within the code to control the sampling process.
By default, a 1:1 sampling ratio is used.

**Note**

Make sure to correctly set the ```save_dir``` to avoid file saving issues.

## Inference with SIDM
The inference code applies interpolation between any two desired data samples.

We provide the ```LabeledDataset``` used in this study.
To perform inference using this dataset, please refer to ```inference.ipynb```.
